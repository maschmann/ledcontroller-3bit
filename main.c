    The device has a RGB LED, which has two states for each "sub-LED",
    on and off.
    The "sub-LEDs" are red, green and blue.

    Obviously there are 8 possible combinations for their state.
    It seems there aren't bits mapped to each sub-LED, but instead
    3-bit values mapped to the 8 combinations.
